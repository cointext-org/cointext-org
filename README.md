# 🧠 Cointext — Context for Every Coin

**Project for Virtuals Ethereum AI Hackathon 2025**  
> “The Knowledge Engine for Web3 — powering AIBRK, fudcan, Virtuals, Base, BSC, Algorand, and beyond.”

---

## 🚀 Overview

**Cointext** is an **AI-powered knowledge base and autonomous Web3 intelligence agent** — providing **real-time context for every coin, wallet, and protocol** across Ethereum L1/L2s.

It merges **AI reasoning, on-chain data, and the Virtuals ACP ecosystem** to make DeFi and Web3 knowledge accessible, actionable, and autonomous.  
Whether you're asking *“What’s trending on Virtuals today?”* or *“Analyze wallet 0x123…”*, Cointext delivers precise, conversational insights in seconds.

## 🧠 Core Innovation

| Category | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Autonomous AI Agent** | Cointext acts as a self-learning knowledge agent that evolves with every query. |
| **On-Chain Reasoning** | Responses are verified or enhanced through blockchain data and smart contract interactions. |
| **Virtuals ACP Integration** | Enables knowledge monetization and engagement via the Butler agent marketplace. |
| **Multi-Chain Coverage** | Supports Base, BSC, and Algorand, with modular adapters for more ecosystems. |
| **Natural Language Interface** | Intuitive chat experience via web, XMTP, or Telegram, making on-chain intelligence conversational. |

## 💡 AI & Technical Excellence

- **Hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for combining blockchain logs + natural language responses.  
- **Dynamic Knowledge Graph** constructed from DeFi protocols, token metadata, and chain-specific events.  
- **Fine-Tuned Prompt Routing** for light_route-based reasoning (RAG-only / Tools-only / Hybrid).  
- **Autonomous Task Execution** — agents plan, reason, and act (e.g., suggest portfolio rebalance).  

---

## 🪙 On-Chain Integration

- Smart contracts deployed on **Base** (Ethereum L2) handle:
  - Agent identity & verification (ACP Agent Registry)
  - Query payment via Butler (service engagement)
  - Record of AI-generated insights (immutable audit trail)
- Supports **EIP-712 signing** for authenticated wallet-based interactions.

## 🧭 Vision

Cointext is building the foundation for a **decentralized knowledge economy** — where every chain, every wallet, and every Virtual has context.  
A true **AI Knowledge Agent** that learns, acts, and transacts autonomously.

> “Cointext turns on-chain noise into meaningful, monetizable knowledge.”
